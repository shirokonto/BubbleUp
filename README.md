# BubbleUp
A 3D game made in Unity using primarily C# and LeapMotion for a course project at HTW Berlin, Germany. :video_game:

Today is your first working day at BubbleUp Inc. and you will be assigned a human from which you have to control the filter bubble.
It is extremely important to ensure that only the right information gets into the bubble, 
because we don't want humans's horizons to expand and the bubble to become large and uncontrollable!
Be aware of other dangers like ads or viruses and use useful items to keep them at bay.
